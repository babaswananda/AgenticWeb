## üìä **SCORING ALGORITHM**

### **Total Fugio Score Calculation**
```
Fugio Score = (AYD √ó 0.25) + (Contracts √ó 0.30) + (Subscription √ó 0.20) + 
              (Staking √ó 0.15) + (AI Usage √ó 0.07) + (Community √ó 0.03)

Maximum Score: 1,000 points
Minimum Score: 0 points
```

### **Credit Tier Mapping**
- **850-1000:** Excellent (Tier 1) - Premium credit access
- **750-849:** Very Good (Tier 2) - Standard credit access  
- **650-749:** Good (Tier 3) - Basic credit access
- **550-649:** Fair (Tier 4) - Limited credit access
- **450-549:** Poor (Tier 5) - Secured credit only
- **0-449:** No Credit - Prepaid only

## üí≥ **CREDIT OUTPUTS**

### **Credit Line Determination**
```javascript
function calculateCreditLine(fugioScore, stakingAmount, monthlyVolume) {
    const baseCredit = {
        850: 50000,  // $50K for Excellent
        750: 25000,  // $25K for Very Good
        650: 10000,  // $10K for Good
        550: 5000,   // $5K for Fair
        450: 1000,   // $1K for Poor
        0: 0         // $0 for No Credit
    };
    
    const stakingMultiplier = Math.min(stakingAmount / 10000, 3.0); // Max 3x
    const volumeMultiplier = Math.min(monthlyVolume / 1000, 2.0);   // Max 2x
    
    return baseCredit[getTier(fugioScore)] * stakingMultiplier * volumeMultiplier;
}
```

### **Interest Rate Model**

#### **Traditional APR (Fiat Off-ramp Users)**
- **Tier 1 (850+):** 3.2% - 5.9% APR
- **Tier 2 (750+):** 5.9% - 8.9% APR
- **Tier 3 (650+):** 8.9% - 12.9% APR
- **Tier 4 (550+):** 12.9% - 18.9% APR
- **Tier 5 (450+):** 18.9% - 24.9% APR

#### **Staking-as-Payment (Protocol Native)**
- **Mechanism:** Users stake $FUGIO or $AGENT instead of paying interest
- **Conversion Rate:** 1% APR = 2% additional staking requirement
- **Benefits:** No cash outflow, builds protocol reputation
- **Example:** 8% APR = 16% additional staking for same credit line

#### **Zero-Interest Tiers (Agent Contributors)**
- **Eligibility:** Active protocol contributors, developers, validators
- **Requirements:** Minimum 6 months contribution history
- **Credit Line:** Based on contribution value and consistency
- **Repayment:** Protocol earnings automatically offset balances
